Dear OAuth.io users,

We are thrilled to announce the official realease of oauthd: the open source version of OAuth.io. Thousands of developers have already registered to OAuth.io for 3 weeks and many of you requested an open source version of OAuth.io. So we listened. And today, it is real.

Help solve OAuth once and for all, by contributing to our Github repository: http://7za.r.mailjet.com/redirects/x2dktlw04f564vksn480jh/github.com/oauth-io/oauthd. If you want to add an OAuth provider to the 70+ providers we currently support, simply make a pull request.

oauthd is published under Affero GPL licence, enabling you to use it for free on your own server. The license requires you to inform us about modifications you would make to oauthd in order to make the whole community benefit from it. If you would like to use it with an other license than Affero GPL please reach us at team@oauth.io

At OAuth.io our mission is to enable developers to integrate OAuth easily, quickly and safely. We hope oauthd will solve a big pain for lots of developers.
