	<p>Hey! I'm {{ blog.authors[0].fullname }} and I'm co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://webshell.io">webshell.io</a> and <a href="https://oauth.io">oauth.io</a>.</p>

	<p>During a week end, I wanted to make a blog easy to configure, easy to spread, with awesome collaboration tools. What could be better than a blog on top of Github using Github pages? I think it's a new simple way for developers to blog. Now, you can use versionning, collaboration and hosting efficiently with Github & Github pages for your blog. I just made a kind of skeleton. Have fun using it :)</p>
